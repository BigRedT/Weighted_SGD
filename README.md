**Description**
Implementation of importance sampling based weighted stochastic gradient descent [1] for L2 normalized logistic regression. [1] demonstrated the weighted SGD scheme for Linear Least Squares where as we demonstrate its use for logistic regression which is a widely used statistical / machine learning technique.
